				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>This site contains a load of extra recommended sets for the board game Dominion. 10 for each combination
					of one or two sets (except for Alchemy on its own, of which their are none due to its card pool being
					very small).</p>
				<p>Each set has a checkbox before its name you can use to keep track of which ones you've played. This is
					automatically saved to your device's local storage, and persists between site visits. This is the only
					data stored and never leaves your device, no privacy problems or cookies here.</p>
				<p>The official sets from the rulebooks are also on their own tab for easy reference and to use the same
					system to keep track of which you've played, if you want to use that.</p>
				<p>This site and all the extra sets are made by Kieran Millar.</p>
				<p>You can contact me on Reddit and Discord. My username on both sites is kieranmillar.</p>

				<h1>FAQ</h1>
				<h2>What does that checkbox do on each set that crosses it out?</h2>
				<p>Use that to cross off sets as you play them, to keep track of which sets you've already played. See the
					About section for more details.</p>
				<h2>What type of kingdoms do you create? Are they all engines?</h2>
				<p>I have tried to strive to design sets where every kingdom pile present feels relevant, although I cannot
					guarantee they will all be used of course. Naturally this is easier to make happen if the board supports
					an engine, so the sets tend to skew heavily towards engines being possible. However, I am also trying to
					aim for variety of gameplay within each group of 10 sets, so the kingdoms that do offer engines have
					them in vastly different degrees of competitiveness, and there are kingdoms with no engine at all.
					Ultimately, its up to the players what kind of decks they build anyway no matter what the set offers.
				</p>
				<h2>Have you playtested these sets?</h2>
				<p>It should be no suprise that it's hard to find people willing to test over 1,000 premade Dominion sets.
					Instead, I played every kingdom 2 player against the Temple Gate Games app's Hard AI. While it's a
					worthy enough opponent, this type of testing can only do so much, but it provided an opportunity to make
					sure the set was fun and offered up the experience I was aiming for. I feel confident the sets should
					play fine on higher player counts, but 4 player is quite a different game to 2 player.</p>
				<h2>Do you distribute cards evenly across sets?</h2>
				<p>For the single expansion sets, the aim was to try and use each card in the set roughly evenly, but in
					practice some cards are just better than others, and sometimes cards have to be used less because
					they're either not contributing or overpowering the sets where they show up. Every card tries its best
					to get a fair shot. For 2 expansion combinations I put less care into using each card equally, but still
					tried to use them all if possible. For landscapes, I limited myself to 2 landscapes per kingdom, and
					some expansions like Empires simply have more than 20 landscapes, and so I can't show them all off
					there, but if you play 2-set combinations too you'll eventually come across them all.</p>
				<h2>Why did you combine Cornucopia and Guilds?</h2>
				<p>This is how they have been sold physically for a long time, which I wanted to match. Sorry if you only
					own one and not the other. Besides, treating them as one allows me to make some more interesting sets.
				</p>
				<h2>Will you do sets for First Editions?</h2>
				<p>No, the plan is to only make sets for the sets in the state they are in-print currently. Making sets for
					removed cards becomes much less relevant for people over time, and it's not like I'm hurting for enough
					sets to make anyway.</p>
				<h2>Will you make sets for combinations of 3 expansions?</h2>
				<p>No, this would increase the total number of sets to over 5 times the amount as only doing all
					combinations of 1 and 2 sets, and I have enough sets to make already.</p>
				<h2>Why not just randomly generate sets?</h2>
				<p>I love randomly generated sets, but some people are looking for hand-crafted sets for a variety of
					reasons, and there are plenty of tools available for random generation if that's what you want to use.
					All of the sets I made for this site were designed by hand, no randomisers were used.</p>
				<h2>What framework do you use to make this site?</h2>
				<p>None! Pure basic Javascript, HTML and CSS!</p>
				<h2>Can I help design sets?</h2>
				<p>No, sorry. I want these to all be mine. Feel free to make your own sites with your own sets.</p>
				<h2>Can I use parts of this site's code for my own purposes?</h2>
				<p>Yes, feel free. You may be interested in the JSON-ified official sets list, for example. I'd rather the
					sets I designed live here though.</p>
